WWW-Mechanize-Plugin-Cache version 0.0.1

This plugin reimplements the WWW::Mechanize::Cached functionality
via a plugin.

HTTP requests will be cached automatically, so repeated requests
to the same URL will only access the page once, with subsequent
requests getting the cached copy directly.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install



DEPENDENCIES

WWW::Mechanize::Pluggable, Cache::FileCache.
